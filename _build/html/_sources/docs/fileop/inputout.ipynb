    "## Overview\n",
    "File operations in Python involve working with files on the file system, such as reading from files, writing to files, appending data, and managing file resources. Python provides built-in functions and methods to perform these operations efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Opening a File:\n",
    "To open a file, you can use the built-in open() function. It takes two parameters: the file name (or path) and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode can be \"r\" for reading, \"w\" for writing, \"a\" for appending, or a combination of these with additional options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists\n"
