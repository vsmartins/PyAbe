    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow you to create reusable code by defining a blueprint for objects, which are instances of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is like a blueprint or a template that describes the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods/functions) that objects of that class should have. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple objects with similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects allow you to organize your code, encapsulate data and functionality, and create modular and reusable components in your programs. They are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming and are widely used in Python and many other programming languages.\n",

    "## Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Class:\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.\n",
    "- It defines the common attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "- It acts as a blueprint from which you can create multiple instances (objects) with similar characteristics.\n",
    "- A class is defined using the class keyword followed by the class name.\n",
    "- It encapsulates related data and functionality into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object (Instance):\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "- It is created from a class using the class constructor (usually the __init__ method).\n",
    "- An object represents a specific instance of the class, and it has its own unique state (attribute values) separate from other objects.\n",
    "- Objects can access and modify the attributes and methods defined in the class.\n",
    "- Objects can have different values for the attributes defined in the class, even though they share the same behavior (methods).\n",
    "- Objects can interact with each other by invoking methods or accessing attributes.\n",

    "Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an object method is a function that is defined inside a class and operates on an instance of that class. Methods can access and modify the attributes of the instance they belong to, and they can also perform other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object methods are defined similarly to regular functions, but they have an additional first parameter called self, which refers to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. This self parameter is used to access the attributes and methods of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object methods are an important aspect of object-oriented programming, as they allow you to encapsulate behavior within a class and provide a convenient way to manipulate instances of that class. By defining methods in a class, you can ensure that all instances of that class have the same behavior and operate in a consistent manner.\n"
