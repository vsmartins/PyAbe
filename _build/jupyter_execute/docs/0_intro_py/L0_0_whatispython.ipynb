    "\n",
    "Python can be a valuable tool for agricultural and biological engineering (ABE) students because it supports the data processing and analysis of large datasets, automation and control of engineering systems, modeling and simulation of agricultural systems, machine learning to improve the use of natural resources and more. The Python applications can be found in the analysis of soil data, crop yields, environmental, biomedical, and create predictive models to improve crop production and sustainability, identify pests and diseases, and optimize irrigation and fertilization practices."
