    "In Python, a function is a named block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It allows you to encapsulate a set of instructions and execute them by calling the function's name. Functions provide modularity and reusability, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions play a crucial role in structuring and organizing code, promoting code reuse, and improving the maintainability and readability of your programs. They allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, making your code more modular and easier to understand and debug.\n",

    "* function_name: The name you give to the function, which should be meaningful and descriptive.\n",
    "* parameters: Optional inputs that you can pass to the function. They are enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. Functions can have zero or more parameters.\n",
    "* `:` The colon that indicates the start of the function's code block.\n",
    "* Code block: The indented block of code that is executed when the function is called. It contains the specific instructions and operations to perform the desired task.\n",
    "* return statement: An optional statement used to specify the value(s) that the function should return when called. If no return statement is used, the function returns None by default.\n",

When the function is called, the value of x is set to 10 and then printed within the function. However, if we try to access x outside the function, we get a NameError because the variable is not defined in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local variables provide encapsulation and allow functions to work with data that is specific to their scope without causing naming conflicts with other parts of the program. They promote modularity and help maintain the integrity of data within functions.\n"
