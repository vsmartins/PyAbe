    "Git is one of the standard version control systems used by developers to save code and work on code collaboratively as a team. Git is a program run on the command line or Anaconda Prompt. If you use Windows, the gitbash program can be downloaded at git-scm.com/downloads. Git was created by Linus Torvalds, who also designed the Linux operating system. GitHub.com (now owned by Microsoft) is a website and service used by programmers and open source projects to share code and allow contributors to propose changes to existing code. Other services such as BitBucket.org can be integrated with git too. Both git and GitHub.com are useful for problem solvers working in teams. Before using git and GitHub.com, it is helpful to understand a couple of terms:\n",
