    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose programming\n",
    "language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer [Guido van\n",
    "Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the\n",
    "[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one\n",
    "of the most commonly used programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular textbooks on Python programming include {cite}`guttag2016introduction` and {cite}`hill2016learning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains\n",
    "such as\n",
    "\n",
    "-   communications\n",
    "-   web development\n",
    "-   CGI and graphical user interfaces\n",
    "-   game development\n",
    "-   multimedia, data processing, security, etc., etc., etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is beginner-friendly and routinely used to teach computer science and\n",
    "programming in top computer science programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is particularly popular within the scientific and data science\n",
    "communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is steadily [replacing familiar tools like\n",
    "Excel](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/3002556/python-replaced-excel-banking)\n",
    "in the fields of finance and banking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The following chart, produced using Stack Overflow Trends, shows one\n",
    "measure of the relative popularity of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/about_py/python_vs_matlab.png\n",
    ":scale: 72%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure indicates not only that Python is widely used but also that\n",
    "adoption of Python has accelerated significantly since 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is driven at least in part by uptake in the scientific\n",
    "domain, particularly in rapidly growing fields like data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the popularity of [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a\n",
    "library for data analysis with Python has exploded, as seen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The corresponding time path for MATLAB is shown for comparison)\n",

    "    rapidly rising share of scientific work around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)\n",
    "suitable for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple programming styles are supported (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is interpreted rather than compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice feature of Python is its elegant syntax --- we\\'ll see many\n",
    "examples later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elegant code might sound superfluous but in fact it\\'s highly beneficial\n",
    "because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remembering how to read from files, sort dictionaries and other such\n",
    "routine tasks means that you don\\'t need to break your flow in order to\n",
    "hunt down correct syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to elegant syntax is an elegant design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions\n",
    "make Python highly expressive, allowing you to get more done with less\n",
    "code.\n",

    "[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve\n",
    "productivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.\n",

    "## Scientific Programming\n",
    "\n",
