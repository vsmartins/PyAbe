## About the author

Dr. Martins is an assistant professor at Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering in Mississippi State University.
Vitor S. Martins is an Assistant Professor of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at the Mississippi State University with expertise in satellite image processing, quantitative remote sensing, and water quality.  
He received a B.Sc. degree (2014) in Agricultural and Environmental Engineering from Federal University of Vicosa, Brazil, M.Sc. degree (2017) in Remote Sensing from Brazilian Institute for Space Research, and a Ph.D. (2020) in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering from Iowa State University.  
Vitor uses satellite multi-spectral images to retrieve water quality parameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll-a, Secchi disk for long-term changes, and hot spot pollution. Vitor integrates field sample collection and satellite images for inland and coastal waters studies.  
Vitor worked on a NASA-funded project as a postdoctoral fellow at Michigan State University for 2 years and has served NASA Earth Science Data System Working Groups (2020-2022) where he contributed to Data Interoperability for Machine Learning Data & satellite remote sensing.

```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
