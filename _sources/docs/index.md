# QuickStart: Python for Biosystems Engineering

This is a short sequence of lectures on Python programming for scientific
work, written by [Vitor S. Martins](http://www.gcerlab.com/).

```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
```


That series contains more
features and applications but also requires more libraries and takes longer to
run.  

Both lecture series are taken from a [more complete set of
lectures](https://python.quantecon.org) on open source computing hosted by
[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org).
