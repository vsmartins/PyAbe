    "## Python installation: Anaconda Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda choice\n",
    "I recommend that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python.\n",
    "Anaconda is a Python distribution that includes various scientific computing libraries, packages, and tools for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. It aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for Python programming in the scientific and data science communities. An alternative distribution of Python is the Python.org, and it comes with Python Interpreter, IDLE (a little text editing program) and all of the Python Standard Library modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon acquiring the Anaconda distribution of Python from Anaconda.com, you receive a Python Interpreter, the Anaconda Prompt (a command line utility), Spyder (a code editor), and approximately 600 additional Python modules that are not part of the Python Standard Library. Moreover, the Anaconda distribution encompasses Anaconda Navigator, a convenient program for swiftly launching Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda distribution of Python offers a multitude of benefits, including the inclusion of Python itself, alongside approximately 600 additional Python packages that are free to install. These supplementary packages comprise many of the most common tools and libraries used to tackle various programming challenges. Opting for Anaconda over the Python version obtainable from Python.org affords you Python and the Python Standard Library, plus the added 600 modules. With Anaconda, you can circumvent the cumbersome task of installing each of these modules individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Anaconda's versatility is evident in its ability to be installed without administrator privileges. This feature is especially useful in situations where program installation is not feasible, such as in school computer labs. Additionally, Anaconda is compatible with MacOS, where the pre-installed version of Python is often outdated and restricted behind a set of administrator privileges, which may cause installation and run-time issues. By utilizing Anaconda instead, these problems can be averted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of Anaconda is its capability to simplify package management and virtual environments. While these may not seem significant to new Anaconda users, as you progress and begin working on larger projects with multiple dependencies, package management and virtual environments become essential. Anaconda's inclusion of Conda, a package and environment manager, streamlines the process and makes it significantly more manageable.\n",

    "### How do I install Anaconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the Anaconda distribution of Python from Anaconda.com, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the [**Anaconda distribution**](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\n",
    "2. Choose the installer file: Select the appropriate installer file for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Make sure to download the Python 3.x version of Anaconda, as it is the latest stable release.\n",
    "3. Download the installer: Click on the download link for the installer file. The file size may be significant, so it might take some time to complete the download.\n",
    "4. Run the installer: Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded .exe file on your computer and double-click on it to run the installer.\n",
    "5. Follow the installation wizard: The Anaconda installation wizard will guide you through the installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation.\n",
    "6. Select the installation options: During the installation, you'll be prompted to choose the installation location and whether you want to add Anaconda to your system's PATH environment variable. It is generally recommended to leave the default options selected unless you have specific requirements.\n",
    "7. Complete the installation: Once you have selected the installation options, proceed with the installation. It may take a few minutes for the installation process to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify the installation: After the installation is finished, you can verify if Anaconda has been successfully installed by opening a new terminal or command prompt window and running the command conda --version. If Anaconda is installed correctly, it will display the version number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended: PyCharm installation\n",
    "\n",
    "PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for Python development. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to streamline the coding process, including code completion, debugging, testing, and version control integration. With its user-friendly interface and extensive functionality, PyCharm offers a powerful environment for Python developers to write, debug, and manage their projects efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the IDE for community (free) or professional in the [JetBrain/PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\n",
    "Once you have it done, you can create a new project, set up your python environment, and start coding! See this guide for more information.\n",
    "[PyCharm setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e53lRPmWrMI)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other online services with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/), short for Google Colaboratory, is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) provided by Google for writing and executing Python code. It allows you to create and share Jupyter notebooks, which are interactive documents containing code, visualizations, and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key features and benefits of using Google Colab for Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cloud-based: Google Colab runs on Google's powerful servers, so you don't need to worry about installing any software or configuring your own development environment. All you need is a web browser and an internet connection.\n",
