    "Anaconda is a Python distribution and provides a user-friendly platform for scientific community. Anaconda installation includes a Python Interpreter (i.e., this is where you can run your codes), the Anaconda Prompt (a command line utility to install new python packages and create environments), Spyder (a code editor) and all Python Standard Library modules. Also, Anaconda distribution has Anaconda Navigator, so the users can launch other applications such as Jupyter notebooks.\n",

There are several editors and below are few examples of popular IDEs or code editors that you can use to write and run Python code. Each IDE may have its own specific features and workflows, but the general steps involve creating a .py file, writing your code, and executing it using the appropriate commands or buttons provided by the IDE.

It allows you to create and share Jupyter notebooks, which are interactive documents containing code, visualizations, and explanatory text. If you prefer, open your web browser and go to the Google Colab website (https://colab.research.google.com/). In the notebook, you can write your Python code in code cells and execute by clicking the \"Play\" button. Remember that the code and data in Colab notebooks are stored temporarily, and the session can time out after a period of inactivity. However, you can save your work to Google Drive or other storage locations to persist your notebooks for future use.\n",
